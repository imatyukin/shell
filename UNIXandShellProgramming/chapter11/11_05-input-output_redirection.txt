INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTION

Standard input	The default input is taken from the standard input device, that is, keyboard It is also known as stdin.
Standard output	The default output goes to the user terminal. It is also known as stdout.
Standard error	The default output goes to the user terminal. It is also known as stderr.

A file stream descriptor is assigned to each of the aforementioned standard streams.
Standard input has a file descriptor of 0.
Standard output uses 1.
Standard errot uses 2.

Output redirection operator
The output redirection operator is represented by the > (greater than) symbol.

command > output_file

Input redirection operator
The input redirection operator is represented by the < (less than) symbol.

command < input_file

Examples
(a) exec 0< tmp
Instead of from the standard input device, the input will be taken from the file tmp.
(b) exec 1 > temp
Instead of the terminal, the standard output will be sent to the file temp.
(c) exec 2> tmpdata
Instead of the terminal, the error stream will be sent to the file tmpdata.
(d) $ ls > tmp
The list of files and directories will be sent to the file tmp, overwriting its earlier contents.
(e) ls > /dev/null
The list of files and directories will not appear on the standard output and will be sent to
the special file /dev/null also referred to as the ‘bit bucket’. The /dev/null fi le discards
all data written to it. It is usually used to suppress the output on the screen.
(f) 1>&3 -
It informs the shell to redirect the output of the standard output stdout to the same place
where output of the file descriptor 3 is sent.
(g) 2>&1
It informs the shell to redirect the output of standard error 2 to the same place where
output of the standard output stdout is sent.
(h) ls > /dev/null 2>&1
The list of files and directories is sent to the special file /dev/null and the 2>&1 indicates
that the output of error channel 2 will also be redirected to the standard output stdout,
thus no output will be sent to the terminal but instead sent to the /dev/null file.
(i) ls > tmp 2>&1
The list of files and directories is sent to the file tmp overwriting its earlier content and
the 2>&1 indicates that the output of error channel 2 will also be redirected to the same
place where standard output stdout is sent, that is, to the file tmp.
(j) To close an input file, the following command is used.
exec 0<&-
(k) To close an output file, the following command is used.
exec 1>&-
(l) To close an output file with file descriptor 3, the following command is used.
exec 3>&-
(m) To close an input file with file descriptor 3, the following command is used.
exec 3<&-

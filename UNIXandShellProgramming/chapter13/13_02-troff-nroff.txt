nroff	It produces output for terminal windows, line printers, and typewriter-like devices.

troff

troff [ -a ] [ -F directory_name ] [-i] [ -T name ] filename

Brief description of options used in the troff command
Option				Description
-a					It generates an ASCII version of the formatted output.
-F directory_name	It searches the given directory, directory_name for font width, or terminal tables. If the directory_name is not specified, the system default directory is used.
-i					It reads the standard input after all the specified input files are read.
-T name				It prepares the output for the specified device instead of the default PostScript printer.
filename			It represents the file that is to be processed.

Brief description of formatting commands used with troff command
Formatting	Description
command
.fi			This fills the text with input (default setting).
.nf			This does not fill the text. The right margin appears ragged.
.br			This breaks the filling and starts a new block of text. The same action can be done by starting a line of text with a space.
.ad			This controls adjustment. Valid arguments are as follows:
			l: Adjusts only the left margin
			r: Adjusts only the right margin
			c: Centres each line
			b or n: Adjusts both margins
			.ce n: Centres the next n lines without filling the text

Brief description of units used in space measurement in the troff command
Option	Description
I		inch
c		centimetre
p		pica
m		em
n		en
p		point
u		unit
v		vertical space

$ troff a.txt
This statement runs troff on the file a.txt.

The output produced by troff is device independent and requires to be post-processed before it can be accepted by most printers.
The syntax for post-processing the input file is as follows:
troff filename | postprocessor

To post-process the troff output for the hp laser jet printer, the subsequent statement is used.
troff filename | hplj

The following command changes the point size of the text on the subsequent lines to 20 points.
.ps 20
Hello

The backslash character (\) is used for applying troff commands and for inserting special characters in the text.
The following statement will make the text appear in 20-point size:
\s20Hello

The following text will make the text World appear in 25-point size and the text Bye to appear in 15-point size:
\s+5World\s-5Bye

nroff

nroff [-o pages] [-h] [-i] [-T name] [filename]

Brief description of options used in the nroff command
Option		Description
-o pages	It displays only the specified pages. The page numbers can be comma separated and a hyphen can be used to represent a range of pages.
-h			It uses TAB characters for horizontal spacing.
-i			It reads the standard input after the input files are read.
-T name		It prepares output for a device of the specified name. Valid options are as follows:
			ascii, ascii8, latin1, utf8, nippon, and cp1047
filename	It represents the document that needs to be formatted for display. If no filename argument is present, nroff reads from the standard input.

nroff a.txt
This statement formats the file a.txt.

.in 5
This statement indents the following text by five spaces.

PREPROCESSORS FOR nroff AND troff

tbl	It formats tables into commands and escape sequences that nroff/troff can understand.
eqn	It typesets mathematical equations and compiles descriptions of equations embedded within troff input files into commands that are understandable by troff.
pic	It is a graphics language preprocessor that compiles pictures embedded within troff input files into commands that are understandable by troff.

Each of these preprocessors translates codes into nroff/troff requests.

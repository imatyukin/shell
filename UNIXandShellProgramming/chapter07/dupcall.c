 * The dup system call returns the file descriptor that points to the same file as the fd descriptor.
 * The dup2 system call makes the file descriptor fd2 point to the same file that the file descriptor fd is pointing at.
 * The system calls return or copy the file descriptor if successful and return a value of âˆ’1 otherwise.

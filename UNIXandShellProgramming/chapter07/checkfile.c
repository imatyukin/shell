/* access(): Checking Permissions
 *
 * man 2 access
 *
 * int access(const char *pathname, int mode);
 *
 * The mode can be represented by the following symbolic constants:
 * 1. F_OK: Checks whether the file exists
 * 2. R_OK: Checks whether the file has read permission
 * 3. W_OK: Checks whether the file has write permission
 * 4. X_OK: Checks whether the file has execute permission
 *
 * On success, that is, if all the requested permissions exist, the system call returns 0.
 * If any requested permission is denied, the system call returns a value âˆ’1 and sets the external variable errno that describes the reason for error.

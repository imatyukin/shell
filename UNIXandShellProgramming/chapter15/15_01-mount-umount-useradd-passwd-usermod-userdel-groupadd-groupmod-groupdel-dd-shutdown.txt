MOUNTING UNIX FILE SYSTEM

mount {device/directory to be mounted} {mount directory} options

The two frequently used mount options are as follows:
-r	It mounts the file system read-only.
-w	It mounts the file system read-write.

(a) # mount /dev/cdrom /mnt
(b) # mount /dev/hda3 /framework

UNMOUNTING UNIX FILE SYSTEM

umount {file system to unmounted} {mount directory} {options}

The frequently used options are as follows:
-a	It unmounts all the mounted file systems.
-f	It forcibly unmounts the file system.

(a) # umount /dev/cdrom /mnt
(b) # umount /dev/hda3 /framework

MANAGING USER ACCOUNTS

Creating User Accounts

useradd -d homedirectory -g groupname -s shell userid

The terms of the syntax represent the following:
-d homedirectory	It refers to the home directory for the new account.
-g groupname		It refers to the group name or ID (GID) to which the new user will belong.
-s shell			It refers to the default shell for the new account.
userid				It refers to the unique user ID (UID) of the new user.

(a) # useradd -d /home/john -g it -s /bin/sh johny123
(b) # useradd -u 200 -g bank -c "Microchip" -d /home/mce -s /bin/ksh -m mce
(c) # useradd -u 250 -g 100 manish

The following syntax is used for changing the password of a given user:
passwd userid

# passwd john

Modifying User Accounts

usermod -d homedirectory -g groupname -s shell -l userid

The syntax can be explained as follows:
homedirectory	It refers to the new home directory that we want to assign to the account.
groupname		It refers to the new group name to which we want the account to belong.
shell			It refers to the new shell that we want to assign to the account.
userid			It refers to the new user ID that we want to assign to the user.
-l				The argument enables us to change the userid.

(a) # usermod -d /home/johny -l johny123 johny777
(b) # usermod -s /bin/csh johny123

Deleting User Accounts

userdel [-r] userid

The -r option is used for deleting a user’s home directory.

$ userdel -r johny777

Creating Groups

groupadd [-g groupid] [-o] [-f] groupname

The syntax can be explained as follows:
groupid		It is the numerical value representing the group’s ID.
			The -g option will create a group with some other ID if the specified groupid already exists.
-o			It indicates to add the group with a non-unique groupid.
-f			It indicates to cancel the command if a group with the specified groupid already exists.
groupname	It is the name of the new group.

(a) $ groupadd -g 21 it
(b) $ groupadd experts

Modifying Groups

$ groupmod [-n] [-g] newgroupname oldgroupname

The -n option is used for changing the group name, whereas the -g option is used for changing the groupid.

(a) $ groupmod -n programmers professionals
(b) $ groupmod -g 58 professionals

Deleting Groups

groupdel groupname

# groupdel professionals

The user’s account information is maintained in the following three files:
/etc/passwd	It contains the user account and password information.
/etc/shadow	It contains the encrypted password of the corresponding account.
/etc/group	It contains the group information for each account.

BACKUP AND RESTORE

tar

tar stands for ‘tape archive’. This command was originally used to backup data to tape.
Nowadays, it is used for copying a large number of files into one larger file for the purpose of backup.
When required, the original files can be extracted from the library.

cpio

cpio stands for ‘copy input output’. This command copies the desired files from one device to another.
Since the cpio command is not able to find files, it is usually used along with the find command.

dd

dd is a very low-level command that is used for copying data from one disk to another.
The following command is used to backup a hard drive named /dev/hda to another hard drive named /dev/hdb:

dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/hdb

SHUT DOWN AND RESTART

shutdown [-h] [-r]

The -h option is used for a complete shutdown, and the -r option is used to restart the system.
We can also use the halt and power off Unix command line utilities for the same purpose.

arp

The arp utility displays and modifies the Internet-to-Ethernet address translation tables that are used by the address resolution protocol (ARP).

arp [-n] [ -a] [-d hostname [ pub]] [-s hostname ethernet_addr [ temp] [
blackhole | reject] [ pub [ only]]] [ -S hostname ethernet_addr] [-f filename]

Different options of arp and their description
Option				Description
-a					It displays all the current ARP entries.
-d hostname [pub]	It deletes an entry for the specified hostname. If the pub keyword is specified, only the ‘published’ ARP entry for the given hostname will be deleted.
					This option can be combined with the the -a option to delete all entries.
-n					It depicts network addresses as numbers. By default, arp displays the addresses symbolically.
-s hostname ethernet_addr [ temp] [ blackhole | reject] [ pub [ only]]
					It creates an ARP entry for the specified hostname with the given Ethernet address ethernet_addr.
					temp		The newly created ARP entry will be temporary in nature. If this option is not used, the entry will be permanent.
					pub			The newly created ARP entry will be ‘published’, i.e., this system will act as an ARP server.
					only		It creates a published (proxy only) entry—the entry that is created automatically if a routing table entry for the hostname already exists.
					reject		It discards the traffic to the host, and the sender will be notified that the host is unreachable.
					blackhole	It discards the traffic to the host but the sender is not notified.
-S hostname ethernet_addr
					This is similar to the -s option with a difference that any existing ARP entry for this host will be deleted first.
-f filename			The information in the file is used for setting multiple entries in the ARP tables.
